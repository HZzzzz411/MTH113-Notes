# Numerical Methods for Describing Data

## Describing the Center of a Data Set
- **Mean**: The **arithmetic average** of all observations.
  - **Sample mean ($\bar{x}$)**: Sum of all observations divided by the number of observations. $$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n}$$
  - **Population mean (µ)**: Average of all values in the entire population.
- **Median**: The **middle value** that divides the data into **two equal parts**.
  - **Left skew**: Many smaller observations, then **Mean < Median**;
  - **Symmetric**: Tails evenly distributed, then **Mean ≈ Median**;
  - **Right skew**: Many larger observations, then **Mean > Median**.

- **Mode**: The **most frequent** value in a data set (applicable to categorical data).

## Describing Variability in the Data
- **Range**: The **difference between** the **largest and smallest** observations.
- **Variance (s²)**: The average of the **squared deviations** from the mean.
  
   $$s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$
- **Standard Deviation (s)**: The square root of the variance, providing a measure of spread in the same units as the data.
  
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1), robust to outliers.

## Summarizing a Data Set: Boxplots
- **Boxplot**: A graphical representation of the five-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum).
  - **Skeletal Boxplot**: Displays the five-number summary.
  - **Modified Boxplot**: Identifies outliers and extends whiskers only to non-outlier data points.
- **Outliers**: Data points that significantly differ from others.
  - Mild outlier: More than 1.5(IQR) away from the nearest quartile.
  - Extreme outlier: More than 3(IQR) away from the nearest quartile.

## Interpreting Center and Variability
- **Standardization**: Expressing deviations from the mean as a proportion of the standard deviation (z-scores).
- **Chebyshev’s Rule**: At least a certain percentage of data lies within k standard deviations of the mean.
- **Empirical Rule**: For normally distributed data, specific percentages of data lie within certain standard deviations of the mean.
- **Percentiles**: Values that divide the data into specified proportions.

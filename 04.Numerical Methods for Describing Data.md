# Numerical Methods for Describing Data

## Describing the Center of a Data Set
- **Mean**: The **arithmetic average** of all observations.
  - **Sample mean ($\bar{x}$)**: Sum of all observations divided by the number of observations. $$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n}$$
  - **Population mean ($\mu$)**: Average of all values in the entire population.
- **Median**: The **middle value** that divides the data into **two equal parts**.
  - **Left skew**: Many smaller observations, then **Mean < Median**;
  - **Symmetric**: Tails evenly distributed, then **Mean ≈ Median**;
  - **Right skew**: Many larger observations, then **Mean > Median**.

- **Mode**: The **most frequent** value in a data set (applicable to categorical data).

## Describing Variability in the Data
- **Range**: The **difference between** the **largest and smallest** observations.
- **Variance ($s^2$)**: The average of the **squared deviations** from the mean.
  
  <div align="center">
   $$s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} =  \frac{\sum (x_i)^2 - n\bar{x}^2}{n-1}$$
  </div>
  
- **Standard Deviation ($s$)**: The **square root of the variance**, providing a measure of spread in the same units as the data.
  <div align="center">
   $s = \sqrt{s^2}$.
  </div>
  
  - the **population's true variance** is **$\sigma^2$** and standard deviation is **$\sigma$**
  
- **Quartiles**:separate the sample in **4 parts**, each containing the ordered 25% of the observations.
  - $Q_{1}$ = Lower quartile: Median of the lower half of the sample
  - $Q_{2}$ = Median
  - $Q_{3}$ = Upper quartile: Median of the upper half of the sample

  (If **n is odd**, the **median** of the entire sample is **excluded from both halves** when computing quartiles.)
  
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The **difference** between the third quartile ($Q_{3}$) and the first quartile ($Q_{1}$), robust to outliers.
  <div align="center">
   $IQR = Q_{3} - Q_{1}$
  </div>

A **general rule of thumb** to compare IQR to $s$, is to divide it by **1.45**.

## Summarizing a Data Set: Boxplots
- **Boxplot**: A graphical representation of the five-number summary (minimum, $Q_{1}$, median, $Q_{3}$, maximum).
  - **Skeletal Boxplot**: Displays the five-number summary.
  - **Modified Boxplot**: Identifies outliers and extends whiskers only to **non-outlier** data points.(useful to identify outliers)

</div>
 
- **Outliers**: Data points that significantly differ from others.
  - **Mild outlier**: More than **1.5 IQR** away from the nearest quartile.
  - **Extreme outlier**: More than **3 IQR** away from the nearest quartile.
    
    (These definitions and distances are based on the **hypothetical Normal distribution**. When there is a reason to suspect that the distribution is skewed, the bounds should be changed.)

## Interpreting Center and Variability
- **Standardized test scores**: Expressing deviations from the mean as a proportion of the standard deviation **(z-scores)**.
  <div align="center">
    $z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}$
  </div>
- **Chebyshev’s Rule**: At least a certain percentage of data lies **within k standard deviations of the mean**.
  <div align="center">
   $\text{Percentage} \geq 100 \left(1 - \frac{1}{k^2}\right) \%$
  </div>
  
- **Empirical Rule**: (normal distribution)
  - 68% within µ ± σ
  - 95% within µ ± 2σ
  - 99.7% within µ ± 3σ
- **Percentiles**: Values that divide the data into specified proportions.(r-th percentile is a value such that **r percent of the observations** in the dataset **fall at or below that value**.)

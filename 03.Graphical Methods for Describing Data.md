# **Graphical Methods for Describing Data**

## **Displaying Categorical Data**
### Comparative Bar Charts
- Used to **visually compare** two or more groups.
- Constructed **using the same set** of horizontal and vertical axes (x,y-axis).
- use **relative frequency** rather than frequency (dealing with **different sample sizes**)

### Pie Charts
- Summarize categorical data by representing categories as **slices of a pie**.
- The size of each slice is **proportional to** the **frequency or relative frequency**.
- **Size**: Angle of slice, $Angle = 360^\circ \times relative ~\ frequency$
- **Most useful for illustrating proportions** of the whole data set for various categories. **Not suitable for comparing** frequencies between groups.

### Segmented Bar Charts
- **Similar to pie charts** (illustrating proportions) but easier to draw by hand.
- Useful for comparing cumulative frequency distributions of ordered categories.

## Displaying Numerical Data
### Stem-and-Leaf Displays
- An effective way to summarize numerical data.
- Each number is split into a **stem (beginning digits)** and a **leaf (final digits)**.
- Easy to spot **outliers** (unusually small or large data value)
- Useful for **small to moderate** data sets.
- **Comparative Stem-and-Leaf Displays**: One group's leaves are listed to the right of the stem values and second group's are listed to the left

### Frequency Distributions and Histograms
- **Frequency Distribution**: A **table** showing the frequency of each value or range of values.
- **Histogram**: A graph of the frequency distribution for numerical data.(similar to bar chart but classes are contiguous, **no gaps** between bars.)
  - **Discrete Numerical Data**: Bars represent individual values or grouped intervals.
  - **Continuous Numerical Data**: Data is grouped into intervals (**class intervals**).
when class intervals are **not of equal width**,  the height of the each rectangle is given by its **density** over that interval.**(the area of the bars must be proportional to the frequency)**

### Histogram Shapes
- **Unimodal**: A single peak.
- **Bimodal**: Two peaks.
- **Multimodal**: More than two peaks.
- **Symmetric**: Equal tails.
- **Skewed**: Unequal tails
  
     **(a).positively/right skewed**: upper(right) tail of the histogram stretches out much farther than the lower(left) tail.
  
     **(b).negatively skewed**: lower tail of the histogram stretches out much farther than the upper tail.

- **Normal:** bell shaped distributions

### Cumulative Relative Frequency
- Shows the proportion of observations **falling below a specified value**.
- Cumulative relative frequency plot: pairs (upper endpoint of interval, cumulative relative frequency)

## Displaying Bivariate Numerical Data
### Scatter Plots
- Used to **detect patterns and outliers** in bivariate data.
- Each observation is a pair of numbers (x, y).
- Aspect Ratio: Plots should be almost **square**.

### Time Series Plots
- Used to observe trends over time.
- Observations are plotted with **time on the horizontal axis**.
- Multiple time series can be plotted together for comparison.

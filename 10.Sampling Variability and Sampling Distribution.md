# Sampling Variability and Sampling Distribution

## Sampling Variability
- **Definition**: The variability of a statistic (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion) **due to different samples** drawn from the same population.
- **statistic**: A quantity computed from the values in a sample is called a statistic

## Sampling Distribution
- **Definition**: The distribution of a statistic (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion) over all possible samples of a given size from a population.
- **Example**: The distribution of sample means from multiple samples of a fixed size.

## Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean
- **Properties**:
  - **Mean**: $\mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu$ ($\mu_{\bar{x}}$: Mean of the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$)
  - **Standard Deviation**: $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ ( $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ Standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$)

These formulas is **exact** if the population is **infinite**, and is **approximately correct** if the population is **finite** and **no more than 10%** of the population is included in the sample.
  - **Shape**:
    - If the **population is normally distributed**, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is also normal for **any sample size $n$**.
    - By the Central Limit Theorem, for sufficiently large $n (n \geq 30)$, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution.
- **Central Limit Theorem**: As the sample size $n$ increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a **normal distribution** with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ (even when the population distribution is not normal).
  - Conditions: Each single sample is essentially a random variable, and they are independent and identically distributed.

## Sampling Distribution of the Sample Proportion
- **Properties**:
  - **Mean**: $\mu_{\hat{p}} = p$ ( $\mu_{\hat{p}}$: Mean of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$)
  - **Standard Deviation**: $\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$
 
This formula is exact if the population is infinite, and is approximately correct if the population is finitie and **no more than 10%** of the population is included in the sample.
  - **Shape**: For large $n$ and $p$ not too close to 0 or 1, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is approximately normal.
- **Rule of Thumb**: If $np \geq 10$ and $n(1 - p) \geq 10$, the normal approximation is reasonable. (The farther the value of p is from 0.5, the larger n must be for a normal approximation to be accurate)

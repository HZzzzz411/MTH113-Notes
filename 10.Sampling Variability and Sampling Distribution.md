# Sampling Variability and Sampling Distribution

## Lecture 9: Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of sampling variability and its implications.
- Describe the general properties of the sampling distribution of the sample mean and sample proportion.
- Determine when the sampling distribution of the sample mean or sample proportion is approximately normal.

## Sampling Variability
- **Definition**: The variability of a statistic (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion) due to different samples drawn from the same population.
- **Example**: Different samples of students may yield different average textbook expenses, reflecting sampling variability.

## Sampling Distribution
- **Definition**: The distribution of a statistic (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion) over all possible samples of a given size from a population.
- **Example**: The distribution of sample means from multiple samples of a fixed size.

## Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean
- **Properties**:
  - **Mean**: \( \mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu \)
  - **Standard Deviation**: \( \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \)
  - **Shape**:
    - If the population is normally distributed, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is also normal for any sample size \( n \).
    - By the Central Limit Theorem, for sufficiently large \( n \), the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution.
- **Central Limit Theorem**: As the sample size \( n \) increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution with mean \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \).

## Sampling Distribution of the Sample Proportion
- **Properties**:
  - **Mean**: \( \mu_{\hat{p}} = p \)
  - **Standard Deviation**: \( \sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \)
  - **Shape**: For large \( n \) and \( p \) not too close to 0 or 1, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is approximately normal.
- **Rule of Thumb**: If \( np \geq 10 \) and \( n(1 - p) \geq 10 \), the normal approximation is reasonable.

## Examples and Applications
- **Blood Platelet Volume**: Analyzing the distribution of platelet volumes in patients to determine if the sample mean is a reliable estimate of the population mean.
- **Time to First Goal in Hockey**: Using the sampling distribution of the sample mean to understand the variability in the time to the first goal in hockey games.
- **Hot Dog Fat Content**: Assessing whether the sample mean fat content of hot dogs is significantly different from the manufacturer's claim using the sampling distribution.

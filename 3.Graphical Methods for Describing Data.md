# **Graphical Methods for Describing Data**

## **Displaying Categorical Data**
### Comparative Bar Charts
- Used to visually compare two or more groups.
- Constructed using the same set of horizontal and vertical axes.
- Example: Comparing ideal college distance preferences between students and parents.

### Pie Charts
- Summarize categorical data by representing categories as slices of a pie.
- The size of each slice is proportional to the frequency or relative frequency.
- Most effective when there are not too many categories.
- Not suitable for comparing frequencies between groups.

### Segmented Bar Charts
- Similar to pie charts but easier to draw by hand.
- Useful for comparing cumulative frequency distributions of ordered categories.

## Displaying Numerical Data
### Stem-and-Leaf Displays
- An effective way to summarize numerical data.
- Each number is split into a stem (beginning digit(s)) and a leaf (final digit(s)).
- Useful for small to moderate data sets.

### Frequency Distributions and Histograms
- **Frequency Distribution**: A table showing the frequency of each value or range of values.
- **Histogram**: A graph of the frequency distribution for numerical data.
  - **Discrete Numerical Data**: Bars represent individual values or grouped intervals.
  - **Continuous Numerical Data**: Data is grouped into intervals (class intervals).

### Histogram Shapes
- **Unimodal**: A single peak.
- **Bimodal**: Two peaks.
- **Multimodal**: More than two peaks.
- **Symmetric**: Equal tails.
- **Skewed**: Unequal tails (positively skewed or negatively skewed).

### Cumulative Relative Frequency
- Shows the proportion of observations falling below a specified value.
- Useful for understanding the distribution of data.

## Displaying Bivariate Numerical Data
### Scatter Plots
- Used to detect patterns and outliers in bivariate data.
- Each observation is a pair of numbers (x, y).
- Example: Relationship between skaters' height and performance scores.

### Time Series Plots
- Used to observe trends over time.
- Observations are plotted with time on the horizontal axis.
- Multiple time series can be plotted together for comparison.

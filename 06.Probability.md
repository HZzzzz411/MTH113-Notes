# Probability

## Sample Space and Events
- **Important Definition**
  - **Chance Experiment**: A process of making an observation when there is **uncertainty** about which of **two or more possible outcomes** will result.
  - **Sample Space**: The **collection of all possible outcomes** of a chance experiment.
  - **Event**: Any collection of outcomes from the sample space.
  - **Simple Event**: An event consisting of **exactly one outcome**.
  - **Complement ($A^C$)**: The event that consists of all outcomes in the sample space that are NOT in event A ($A'$, $\hat{A}$).
  - **Union ($A \cup B$)**: The event that consists of **all outcomes in at least one** of the two events.
  - **Intersection ($A \cap B$)**: The event that consists of **all outcomes in both** events.
  - **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Two events that have **no outcomes in common** ($A \cap B = \emptyset$ ).
- **De Morganâ€™s Law**: Let A and B be any two events in a sample space. Then

  $(A \cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C$
  
  $(A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C$
</div>

## Counting
- **Basic Counting Rule**: If **k actions** are to be performed **in a sequence**, and there are $m_{1}$ possibilities for the first action, $m_{2}$ for the second, etc., then the total number of possibilities is $m_{1} \cdot m_{2} \cdot ... \cdot m_{k}$.
- **Permutation**: An arrangement of a number of objects in a **specific order**.
  - **Permutation Rule**: Number of permutations of k objects from n different objects:
    - With repetition: $n^k$
    - Without repetition: $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
- **Combination**: A selection of distinct objects **without regard to order**.
  - **Combination Rule**: Number of combinations of k objects from n different objects:
    - $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$

## Probability
- **Probability of an Event (P(E))**: Describes how likely an event E occurs.
- **Classical Approach**: When outcomes in the sample space of a chance experiment are equally likely, $P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes favorable to E}}{\text{Number of outcomes in the sample space}}$.
- **Relative Frequency Approach**: $\frac{\text{Number of times event E occurs}}{\text{Number of experiments performed}}$.
  - **Theorem (Law of Large Numbers)**:

    As the **number of repetitions of a chance experiment increases**, the chance that the relative frequency of occurrence for an event will differ from the true probability of the event by more than any small number **approaches 0**.

    $P(E) \approx \frac{\text{Number of times event E occurs}}{\text{Number of experiments performed}}$
    
- **Subjective Approach**: Probability is interpreted as a **personal measure** of the **strength of belief** that a particular event will occur.
  
- **Probability Axioms**:
  - $0 \leq P(E) \leq 1$
  - $P(S) = 1$ (where S is the sample space)
  - If E and F are mutually exclusive, $P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F)$.

## Conditional Probability
- **Conditional Probability (P(E|F))**: The probability of event E **given that** event F has occurred.

<div align="center"> 
  
 $P(E|F) = \frac{P(E \cap F)}{P(F)}$ 
</div>

## Independence of Events
- **Independent Events**: Two events E and F are independent if knowing that one event has occurred does not change the probability of the other event.
  - Mathematically, $P(E|F) = P(E)$ and $P(F|E) = P(F)$
- **Dependent Events**: If two events are not independent
- **Theorem**: If two events E and F are independent, then:
    <div align="center"> 
   $P(E^C|F) = P(E^C)$, $P(E|F^C) = P(E)$, $P(E^C|F^C) = P(E^C)$
   </div>
- **Multiplication Rule for Independent Events**: If E and F are independent, $P(E \cap F) = P(E)P(F)$.

## General Probability Rules
- **General Addition Rule for Two Events**: For any events E and F, $P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E \cap F)$
- **General Addition Rule for Three Events**: For any events E, F, and G, $P(E \cup F \cup G) = P(E) + P(F) + P(G) - P(E \cap F) - P(E \cap G) - P(F \cap G) + P(E \cap F \cap G)$
- **General Multiplication Rule for Two Events**: For any events E and F, $P(E \cap F) = P(E|F)P(F)$
- **General Multiplication Rule for Three Events**: For any events E, F, and G, $P(E \cap F \cap G) = P(E|F \cap G)P(F|G)P(G)$.

## **Law of Total Probability**:
For mutually exclusive events $E_1, E_2, \ldots, E_k$ that partition the sample space, 

$P(E) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} P(E \cap E_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} P(E|E_i)P(E_i)$.

## Bayes' Rule
- **Bayes' Rule**: For mutually exclusive and exhaustive events $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_k$ and any event E,
  
  $P(B_i|E) = \frac{P(E|B_i)P(B_i)}{P(E)}$, where $P(E) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}P(E|B_i)P(B_i)$.

## Sampling Methods
- **Sampling with Replacement**: Each selection is independent as the item is returned to the population.
- **Sampling without Replacement**: Each selection affects the probability of subsequent selections as the item is not returned to the population.

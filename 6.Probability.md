# Probability

## Sample Space and Events
- **Important Definition**
  - **Chance Experiment**: A process of making an observation when there is **uncertainty** about which of **two or more possible outcomes** will result.
  - **Sample Space**: The **collection of all possible outcomes** of a chance experiment.
  - **Event**: Any collection of outcomes from the sample space.
  - **Simple Event**: An event consisting of **exactly one outcome**.
  - **Complement ($A^c$)**: The event that consists of all outcomes in the sample space that are NOT in event A ($A'$, $\hat{A}$).
  - **Union ($A \cup B$)**: The event that consists of **all outcomes in at least one** of the two events.
  - **Intersection ($A \cap B$)**: The event that consists of **all outcomes in both** events.
  - **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Two events that have **no outcomes in common** ($A \cap B = \emptyset$ ).
- **De Morgan’s Law**: Let A and B be any two events in a sample space. Then


## Counting
- **Basic Counting Rule**: If k actions are to be performed in a sequence, and there are m1 possibilities for the first action, m2 for the second, etc., then the total number of possibilities is m1 · m2 · ... · mk.
- **Permutation**: An arrangement of a number of objects in a specific order.
  - Number of permutations of k objects from n different objects:
    - With repetition: \( n^k \)
    - Without repetition: \( \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \)
- **Combination**: A selection of distinct objects without regard to order.
  - Number of combinations of k objects from n different objects: \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \)

## Probability
- **Probability of an Event (P(E))**: Describes how likely an event E occurs.
- **Classical Approach**: When outcomes are equally likely, \( P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes favorable to E}}{\text{Number of outcomes in the sample space}} \).
- **Relative Frequency Approach**: Probability is the value approached by the relative frequency of occurrence of E when a chance experiment is performed many times.
- **Subjective Approach**: Probability is interpreted as a personal measure of the strength of belief that a particular event will occur.
- **Probability Axioms**:
  1. \( 0 \leq P(E) \leq 1 \)
  2. \( P(S) = 1 \) (where S is the sample space)
  3. If E and F are mutually exclusive, \( P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F) \)

## Conditional Probability
- **Conditional Probability (P(E|F))**: The probability of event E given that event F has occurred.
  \[
  P(E|F) = \frac{P(E \cap F)}{P(F)}
  \]
- **Law of Total Probability**: For mutually exclusive events \( E_1, E_2, \ldots, E_k \) that partition the sample space, \( P(E) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} P(E \cap E_i) \).
- **Bayes' Rule**: Relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.
  \[
  P(E|F) = \frac{P(F|E)P(E)}{P(F)}
  \]
